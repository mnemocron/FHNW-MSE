    "\n",
    "### What is quantum volume?\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to compare two physical quantum computing machines. It simplifies quantum computer specifications down to one benchmark score in order to compare them. The bigger the quantum volume, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What physical architecture does the quantum backends use?\n",
    "\n",
    "They use different ones depending on the backend. You can find the details for the backends when you click on the individual machine under [ibm.com/services](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/services)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Does the choice of the layout matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, it does because of two things: \n",
    "1. The topology of the circuit (how qubits are physically connected) if you do a 2-qubit gate you whether need 2 qubits which are connected or add some extra gates to kind of \"create\" that connection and therefore those extra gates will add noise.\n",
    "2. The error rates associated to 1-single qubit gates, measurement and connection among qubits, in order to get the best result you may choose wisely the top qubits available so that the noise is minimized\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are Bra and Ket used? What is the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "For pure Quantum States without superposition it does not matter. Bra and Ket are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Eigenstate of a Matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an example of a correlated state that is not entangled?\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be correlated states that are not entangled. But entangled states are always correlated (is this true?).\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixed state is an example of a correlated state that is not entangled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Do we know the initial state in reality?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is it possible to craft an `AND` gate without introducing an additional target qbit?\n",
    "\n",
    "No because the AND operation is not reversible.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why is it not reversible?\n",
    "\n",
    "reversible = if you only have the output, do you know the input?\n",
    "If you observe a \"0\", you do not know if the input was \"00\", \"01\" or \"10\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### When running gates on machines that don't have the appropriate gates, the code changes automatically to make equivalent gates, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but this might produce a lot of gates potentially increasing the error rate\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes using [transpile](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.compiler.transpile.html)\n",
