    "\n",
    "(guaranteed exam question)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** is when the model is too detailed and only learns the data by heart instead of generalizing and simplifying the data into a usable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Underfitting** is when the model is too simple and not able to fit important variations in the data.\n",

    "### What is the fundamental idea behind SVMs?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The fundamental idea behind Support Vector Machines is to ﬁt the widest possible «street»between the classes. In other words, the goal is to have the largest possible margin between the decision boundary that separates the two classes and the training instances.\n",
    "When performing soft margin classiﬁcation, the SVM searches for a compromise between perfectly separating the two classes and having the widest possible street (i.e., a few in-stances may end up on the street). Another key idea is to use kernels when training on nonlinear datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a support vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "> After training an SVM, a support vector is **any instance located on the «street», including its border**. The decision boundary is entirely determined by the support vectors. Any instance that is not a support vector (i.e., oﬀ the street) has no inﬂuence whatsoever; you could remove them, add more instances, or move them around, and as long as they stay oﬀ the street they won’t aﬀect the decision boundary. Computing the predictions only involves the support vectors, not the whole training set.\n",

    "> An SVM classiﬁer can output the distance between the test instance and the decision boundary, and you can use this as a conﬁdence score. However, this score cannot be directly converted into an estimation of the class probability. If you set probability=True when creating an SVM in Scikit-Learn, then after training it will calibrate the probabilities using Logistic Regression on the SVM’s scores (trained by an additional ﬁve-fold cross-validation on the training data). This will add the `predict_proba()` and `predict_log_proba()` methods to the SVM.\n",

The computational complexity of the primal form of the SVM problem is proportional to the number of training instances N, while the computational complexity of the dual form is proportional to a number between N2 and N3. So if the3re are millions of instances, you should deﬁnitely use the primal form, because the dual form will be much too slow.\n",
